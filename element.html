										My story starts with an Canon Rebel T5 DSLR cam, with an emotional content
										for taking best images over  strength and impact over the years, regardless of the number of times they are viewed.
										For getting an instance, a landscape image cuts across all political and national boundaries, 
										it transcends the constraints of language and culture.<br>

										<p>Feathers positively symbolize trust, integrity, strength, wisdom, power, and freedom.
											The foundation of this hobby was created in my first ever summer vacation project know was
											Collection of feathers. At initial stage, I just have to collect 10 different birds feather but later on 
											after scoring A+ grade in project, I carried on collecting more feathers that lead me to explore many jungles back in India,
											and right now I am having approx. 50 different bird feathers.
